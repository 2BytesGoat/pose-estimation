# Godot Pose Estimation 
This project aims to bring monocular-pose-estimation to Godot. 

## Special thanks to

## ToDos
* [x] debug `joint-angles-calculate` refactor to see why we have bad angles
* [ ] check what is the diference between `pose_landmarks` and `pose_world_landmarks`
* [ ] document the calculation of joint angles procedure
* [ ] make project readme prettier
